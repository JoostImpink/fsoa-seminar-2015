These financial statements are the\n          responsibility of the Company\'s management.&#160; Our responsibility is to\n          express an opinion on these financial statements based on our\n          audits.\n        \n        We\n          conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company\n          Accounting Oversight Board (United States).&#160;

The Company is not\n          required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal\n          control over financial reporting.&#160; Our audits included consideration of\n          internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit\n          procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose\n          of\n          expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company\'s internal control\n          over financial reporting.&#160; Accordingly, we express no such\n          opinion.&#160;\nAn\n          audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the\n          amounts\n          and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles\n          used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating\n          the\n          overall financial statement presentation.&#160;

(&#147;Aetna&#148;) and its subsidiaries (collectively, the &#147;Company&#148;).\n\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\n\nWe are one of the nation&#146;s leading diversified health care benefits companies, serving\napproximately 27.9&nbsp;million unique members with information and resources to help them make better\ninformed decisions about their health care. We offer a broad range of traditional and\nconsumer-directed health insurance products and related services, including medical, pharmacy,\ndental, behavioral health, group life, long-term care and disability plans, and medical management\ncapabilities. Our customers include employer groups, individuals, college students, part-time and\nhourly workers, health plans and government-sponsored plans. Our operations are conducted in three\nbusiness segments: Health Care, Group Insurance and Large Case Pensions.\n\n\nThe following MD&#038;A provides a review of our financial condition as of December&nbsp;31, 2005 and 2004\nand results of operations for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. This Overview\nshould be read in conjunction with the entire MD&#038;A, which contains detailed information that is\nimportant to understanding our results of operations and financial condition. This Overview is\nqualified in its entirety by the full MD&#038;A below.\n\n\n\nDuring\n2005, we continued to improve our operating earnings, cash flows from operations and\nfinancial position\n\n\n\nThe period of 2002 to 2004 was one of financial turnaround for us as a company. After recording\noperating losses in 2001, we returned to profitability in 2002 due primarily to significant premium\nrate increases, targeted reductions of unprofitable membership and an increased focus on managing\nrising health care costs. During 2003, our financial performance improved, although our medical\nmembership and revenue declined. During the last two years, significant accomplishments that have helped improve our\noperating earnings, cash flows from operations as well as overall financial position include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    &nbsp;\n    &#216;\n    &nbsp;\n    Growth in medical membership and our specialty products combined with premium and\nfee rate increases contributed to increases in total revenues.\n\n\n\n    &nbsp;\n\n    &nbsp;\n    &#216;\n    &nbsp;\n    Disciplined pricing and our continued focus on managing medical costs led to\nimproved health care underwriting results.\n\n\n\n    &nbsp;\n\n    &nbsp;\n    &#216;\n    &nbsp;\n    Consistent focus on operating expenses led to greater efficiencies.\n\n\n\n    &nbsp;\n\n    &nbsp;\n    &#216;\n    &nbsp;\n    Effective deployment of substantial capital for share repurchases, strategic\nacquisitions and pension plan funding.\n\n\n\n\nDuring 2004 and 2005, we experienced membership increases in both our fully-insured and our\nadministrative service contract (&#147;ASC&#148;) books of business. Our medical membership increased by 1.1\nmillion members in 2005 and 654,000 members in 2004. In addition, during this period we had\ngrowth in our specialty products of dental, pharmacy and group insurance. As of December&nbsp;31, 2005,\nwe served approximately 14.8&nbsp;million medical members, 13.1&nbsp;million dental members, 9.4&nbsp;million\npharmacy members and 13.6&nbsp;million group insurance members. Premium and fee rate increases, coupled\nwith the growth in membership, helped expand our total revenues, which increased approximately $2.6\nbillion in 2005 and $1.9&nbsp;billion in 2004.\n\n\nThe underwriting results in our health care business reflect our focus on medical cost management\nand our pricing policy of achieving premium yields that are in-line with medical cost trends.\nThese factors contributed to comparatively stable medical cost ratios during the years 2003 through\n2005.\n\n\nThe combination of total revenue growth, consistent underwriting approach and increased operating\nexpense efficiency has contributed to an improvement in our operating\nearnings. These efforts have also\ncontributed to improved cash flows from operations (refer to &#147;Liquidity and Capital Resources&#148;).\nIn addition, our cash position was further benefited from certain tax refund claims approved in 2004. Approximately $735&nbsp;million of the total\nrefund claims were received in 2005 and 2004. An additional $40&nbsp;million was received in February\n2006.\n\n\n\nPage 1\n\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary of Consolidated Results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    &nbsp;\n    &nbsp;\n    &nbsp;\n    &nbsp;\n    &nbsp;\n    &nbsp;\n  ',
  'Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control Over Financial\nReporting\n\n\nThe Board of Directors and Shareholders\nAetna Inc.:\n\n\nWe have audited management&#146;s assessment, included in the accompanying Management&#146;s Report on\nInternal Control Over Financial Reporting, that Aetna Inc. maintained effective internal\ncontrol over financial reporting as of December&nbsp;31, 2005, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control&#151;Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of\nthe Treadway Commission (COSO). Aetna Inc.&#146;s management is responsible for maintaining\neffective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness\nof internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on\nmanagement&#146;s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#146;s internal control\nover financial reporting based on our audit.\n\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting\nOversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to\nobtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting\nwas maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of\ninternal control over financial reporting, evaluating management&#146;s assessment, testing and\nevaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such\nother procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit\nprovides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n\nA company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide\nreasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of\nfinancial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted\naccounting principles. A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting includes those\npolicies and procedures that (1)&nbsp;pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable\ndetail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the\ncompany; (2)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit\npreparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance\nwith authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)&nbsp;provide reasonable\nassurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or\ndisposition of the company&#146;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial\nstatements.\n\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent\nor detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future\nperiods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in\nconditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n\nIn our opinion, management&#146;s assessment that Aetna Inc. maintained effective internal control\nover financial reporting as of December&nbsp;31, 2005, is fairly stated, in all material respects,\nbased on criteria established in Internal Control&#151;Integrated Framework issued by the Committee\nof Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Also, in our opinion, Aetna Inc.\nmaintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of\nDecember&nbsp;31, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal Control&#151;Integrated Framework\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\n\n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting\nOversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Aetna Inc. and subsidiaries\nas of December&nbsp;31, 2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated statements of income,\nshareholders&#146; equity and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended\nDecember&nbsp;31, 2005, and our report dated March&nbsp;1, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on those\nconsolidated financial statements.\n\n\n/s/ KPMG LLP\n\n\nHartford, Connecticut\nMarch&nbsp;1, 2006\n\n\n\n\nPage 88\n\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\n\n\nThe Board of Directors and Shareholders\nAetna Inc.:\n\n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Aetna Inc. and subsidiaries as\nof December&nbsp;31, 2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated statements of income,\nshareholders&#146; equity and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended\nDecember&nbsp;31, 2005.

An\n  audit includes consideration of internal control over financial reporting as\n  a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the\n  circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the\n  effectiveness of the Company&#146;s internal control over financial\n  reporting.&nbsp; Accordingly, we express no\n  such opinion.&nbsp; An audit also includes\n  examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures\n  in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and\n  significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial\n  statement presentation.&nbsp; We believe\n  that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n  \n \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn our opinion, the\nfinancial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material\nrespects, the consolidated financial position of Affinity Group, Inc. and\nsubsidiaries at December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the consolidated results of\ntheir operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period\nended December 31, 2005, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting\nprinciples.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n \n  \n  February 10, 2006\n  \n  \n  /s/ Ernst &amp; Young\n  LLP\n  \n \n \n  \n  Woodland Hills,\n  California\n  \n  \n  &nbsp;\n  \n \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n43\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAFFINITY\nGROUP, INC.
